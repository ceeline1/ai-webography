    <tr><th>Abstract</th><td>This NTIA report explores the ethical challenges surrounding artificial intelligence and how developers can build safer and more responsible AI systems. It focuses on potential harms such as algorithmic bias, lack of transparency, privacy violations, and unsafe decision-making. The report stresses the importance of evaluating the social impacts of AI technologies and ensuring systems are designed with fairness, accountability, and transparency in mind. It calls for strong oversight and better governance to avoid the misuse of AI in sensitive areas such as criminal justice, healthcare, and finance. Importantly, the report includes recommendations for minimizing these risks by improving the design process, implementing robust testing, and involving diverse perspectives during development. It serves as a foundation for shaping policies that ensure AI benefits society while minimizing unintended consequences. This document is especially valuable for understanding the real-world concerns and ethical responsibilities that come with building intelligent systems used in public and private sectors alike.</td></tr>

    <tr><th>Abstract</th><td>This NASA webpage provides a clear framework for developing and using artificial intelligence responsibly. It introduces six key principles: fairness, transparency, accountability, safety, human-centered design, and scientific rigor. The page explains that AI systems should always be built with safeguards to prevent bias and misuse while being monitored by qualified personnel. NASA emphasizes that AI must benefit society, be explainable and testable, and undergo regular validation to maintain accuracy. It also highlights the importance of documenting how an AI system works, ensuring that users understand what it can and cannot do. This framework is a model for other organizations looking to develop ethical AI policies. Overall, the guidelines reflect NASA's commitment to innovation grounded in responsibility, showing how ethical design can shape the future of AI in a way that prioritizes human well-being, transparency, and accountability.</td></tr>
