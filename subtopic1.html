    <tr><th>Abstract</th><td>This webpage from NASA offers an in-depth look into the definition, purpose, and real-world applications of artificial intelligence. It describes how AI systems mimic human cognitive abilities like reasoning, learning, and language understanding. The article highlights how AI is currently being used to support NASA missions, such as interpreting satellite imagery, managing spacecraft data, and enhancing robotics in space exploration. It also notes the significance of AI in predictive analytics, allowing NASA to forecast trends and make mission-critical decisions. The piece explains how the combination of big data and AI technologies allows for faster and more accurate results than traditional computing methods. By demonstrating real-world uses in both Earth and space sciences, the article makes it clear that AI is a key component in NASA's pursuit of innovation and discovery. It emphasizes that AI is not just theoretical—it is actively transforming how scientific research and technological exploration are done every day.</td></tr>

    <tr><th>Abstract</th><td>This article shares the remarkable story of Joseph Coates, a man diagnosed with a rare and life-threatening condition called POEMS syndrome. When traditional treatments failed and doctors gave up hope, Coates’s partner reached out to a medical researcher who used artificial intelligence to explore alternative solutions. The AI system sifted through enormous databases of medical information and proposed a specific combination of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and steroids. Following this AI-guided treatment plan, Coates’s health significantly improved, and he was later able to undergo a successful stem cell transplant. The article illustrates how AI is transforming the field of medicine by rapidly identifying solutions that human doctors may overlook. It also underscores the potential for AI to revolutionize treatment plans, drug discovery, and patient care. The story provides a human example of how AI can extend lives and support more personalized healthcare, ultimately showing that AI can be a tool of hope in dire medical circumstances.</td></tr>
